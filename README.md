## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

I will definitely divide more attention to accessibility and commenting in the future. Plus, I also plan on starting to follow the BEM naming standards.

### Useful resources

- [sr-only class](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/why-and-how-the-bootstrap-sr-only-class-is-used.html) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [rel=”noreferrer noopener”](https://www.reliablesoft.net/noreferrer-noopener/) - This is an amazing article that explains the meaning and usage of HTML attributes noopener and noreferrer as well as their impact on SEO.
