## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS pre-processor (SASS)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention

### What I learned

While working on this project I learned more about the HTML5 semantics and accessibility.

```html
<h1 class="screen-readers-only">Profile card component</h1>
```
```css
.screen-readers-only {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  border: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

I will definitely divide more attention to accessibility and commenting in the future. Plus, I also plan on starting to follow the BEM naming standards.
